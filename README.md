A workout tracker to view, create, and track daily workouts. This application uses MongoDB to store and update the database. 

## User Story

```md
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
```

## Requirements

Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.
